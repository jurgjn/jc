# Journal club

**What:** a journal club loosely focused on cancer

**Why:** a lot of people are approaching cancer from a variety of angles: essentiality/drug sensitivity/combination screens, structure, expression signatures, pathway activities, etc. Aim to learn/discuss the state-of-the-art adjacent to your niche-of-choice.
